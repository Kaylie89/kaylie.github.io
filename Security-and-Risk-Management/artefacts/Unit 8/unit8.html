                <p>This unit focuses on demonstrating the use of Monte Carlo simulations and Bayes Theorem to apply quantitative risk modelling (QRM) to real-world problems. We will discuss the application of these techniques as part of the project management process and as a safety estimating tool.</p>

                <p>The seminar provided practical insights into how QRM techniques are implemented and evaluated. Below is the reflective piece on this unit:</p>

                <p>In this unit, I learned how to implement quantitative risk models using Monte Carlo simulations and Bayes Theorem. The application of these techniques to real-world problems provided valuable insights into the project management process and safety estimation.</p>
                <p>The insights gained from engaging with the seminar content and the reading materials, especially the articles by Goerlandt et al. (2017), Hugo et al. (2018), and Çelikbilek & Tüysüz (2020), were crucial in deepening my understanding of quantitative risk analysis (QRA) approaches. These readings helped me explore different validation techniques for QRA, the application of QR analysis in project management, and the evaluation of Multi-Criteria Decision Methods (MCDMs).</p>
                <p>The critical appraisal of these readings and the implementation of the Monte Carlo simulation in Chapter 5 of Olson & Desheng (2020) has equipped me with practical skills that I will apply in future projects. This knowledge will be instrumental in completing the QR model for the final project in Unit 11.</p>

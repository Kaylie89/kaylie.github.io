                <p>This unit introduced me to various threat modelling techniques, enhancing my ability to identify and manage threats effectively. Understanding the differences between threats and vulnerabilities was crucial in selecting the appropriate threat modelling approach. The recommended readings, especially Shevchenko et al. (2018) and Shostack et al. (2020), were instrumental in helping me choose the STRIDE framework for assignment 6. The seminar discussions highlighted the practical application of these techniques, which is essential for my future role as a security professional.</p>

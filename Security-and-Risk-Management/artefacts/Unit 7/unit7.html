                <p>In this unit, I gained valuable insights into the concepts and techniques of quantitative risk modelling (QRM). The lecturecast provided a thorough understanding of methods such as Monte Carlo simulations and Bayes theorem-based models. This knowledge was particularly useful as I prepared for assignment 11, where I chose to apply Monte Carlo simulations to model complex risk scenarios. The comprehensive overview of the advantages and limitations of each approach helped me select the most suitable technique for different real-world problems. Overall, this unit has significantly enhanced my ability to utilize quantitative risk modelling techniques effectively.</p>

                <p>Working on the Risk Identification Report provided me with a deeper understanding of how GDPR regulations and other industry standards apply in real-world scenarios. Collaborating with my peer enhanced my ability to communicate and share ideas effectively. One challenge we faced was interpreting complex regulatory requirements, but we overcame this by consulting additional resources and seeking feedback from our tutor. This knowledge is vital for my development as a security professional.</p>

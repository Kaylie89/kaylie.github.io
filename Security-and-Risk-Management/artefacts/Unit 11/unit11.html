                <p>This unit focused on reviewing current and emerging trends in security and risk management, examining inputs from areas such as economic theory, AI, and automation.</p>
                <h3>Key Concepts Covered</h3>
                <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
                    <li><strong>Current and Emerging Trends:</strong> Understanding various trends in security and risk management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pros and Cons:</strong> Discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each trend.</li>
                    <li><strong>Influence on Future Directions:</strong> Evaluating the potential impact of these trends on future developments in the field.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The seminar on future trends provided valuable insights into how emerging trends might influence security and risk management strategies. To the right is the reflective piece on this unit followed by the artefacts:</p>

                <p>The final project in Unit 11 was an individual task, building on the collaborative work I completed with a fellow student in Unit 6. The experience from Unit 6 was invaluable as it provided a strong foundation in teamwork, critical thinking, and problem-solving.</p>
                <p>This project was a follow-on report from Unit 6, but with a stronger focus on quantitative assessment and the development of a comprehensive disaster recovery (DR) plan. The skills and insights gained from the collaborative project in Unit 6 significantly enhanced my ability to approach this individual project with confidence and competence.</p>
                <p>The quantitative risk modelling techniques I applied, such as Monte Carlo simulations, allowed me to perform a detailed risk assessment. Additionally, creating a DR plan required a thorough understanding of recovery objectives and practical solutions to ensure business continuity.</p>
                <p>This unit not only helped consolidate my learning but also provided an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to work independently, applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios effectively. The process of developing and implementing the final project was a valuable learning experience that has prepared me well for future professional challenges.</p>

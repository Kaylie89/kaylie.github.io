                    <p><strong>Team Name:</strong> Cyber Risk Rangers</p>
                    <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Successfully analyse and present a comprehensive risk assessment and digital transformation strategy for Pampered Pets.</p>
                    <p><strong>Expectations:</strong> Full participation in scheduled meetings unless excused for valid reasons, active involvement in discussions and decision-making processes, regular updates via email or group chat at least twice a week, and commitment to high-quality, thoroughly researched and well-prepared deliverables.</p>
                    <p><strong>Policies & Procedures:</strong> Complete all assigned readings and preliminary research before meetings, use brainstorming sessions at the beginning of each phase to gather and refine ideas, and regularly review progress against milestones and adjust plans as necessary to stay on target.</p>
                    <p><strong>Roles:</strong> Each member will have 50/50 of the workload and co-operate at least twice per week accordingly. The professor can contact any of the two members for co-ordination and updates.</p>
                    <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Address issues of non-performance or non-compliance with expectations directly in team meetings. Implement a two-strike policy—after one warning, a meeting with a faculty advisor will be scheduled to discuss the member’s future on the team. If a dispute persists, escalate to a faculty advisor for mediation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Signatures:</strong> Kaylie Watts (07/05/24), Marcos Brando Paredes (07/05/24)</p>

                    <p>This unit provided foundational knowledge in Security and Risk Management. The team contract exercise highlighted the importance of clear communication and defined roles in successful project management. Through the readings and activities, I learned how to assess and mitigate risks using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. This unit has significantly contributed to my understanding of risk management in the context of information security.</p>

                <p>This unit provided foundational knowledge in Security and Risk Management. The team contract exercise highlighted the importance of clear communication and defined roles in successful project management. Through the readings and activities, I learned how to assess and mitigate risks using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. This unit has significantly contributed to my understanding of risk management in the context of information security.</p>

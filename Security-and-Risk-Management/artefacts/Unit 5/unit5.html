                <p>In this unit, I learned about various industry-specific security standards and their impact on security and risk assessments. Understanding these standards is crucial for developing effective security strategies that comply with regulatory requirements. The insights gained from reading <a href="https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.uniessexlib.idm.oclc.org/doi/10.1002/smr.1984">ISO 31000-based integrated risk management process assessment model for IT organizations</a> by Barafort et al. (2019) were particularly influential in my decision to choose a specific framework for assignment 6. The article provided an in-depth analysis of security standards and their application, which has been essential for my understanding and implementation of robust security measures in various industries.</p>

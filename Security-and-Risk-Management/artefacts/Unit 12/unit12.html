                <p>Engaging in the debate on future SRM trends was an enlightening experience. It required thorough preparation, including a deep dive into the reading materials and wiki entries from Unit 11. This process significantly enhanced my understanding of various emerging trends in SRM.</p>
                <p>Participating in the debate helped me develop critical thinking and public speaking skills. Collaborating on wiki entries provided diverse perspectives, enriching my understanding of the trends.</p>
                <p>The insights gained from this unit were instrumental in shaping my final e-Portfolio submission, where I synthesized my learning and reflections from the entire course. Evaluating and debating future trends has equipped me to anticipate and adapt to changes in the SRM landscape effectively.</p>

                <p>This unit brought together our knowledge and experiences to debate the most influential trends in Security and Risk Management (SRM) for the next five years. We engaged in dynamic discussions, evaluating emerging trends and their potential impact on the field.</p>
                <h3>Key Concepts Covered</h3>
                <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
                    <li><strong>Debate Preparation:</strong> Formulating arguments to support or oppose various trends in SRM.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wiki Completion:</strong> Enhancing our understanding through collaborative entries on future trends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trend Evaluation:</strong> Critically assessing the influence of different trends on the future of SRM.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This unit provided a platform to consolidate our knowledge and engage in a dynamic discussion about the future of SRM. To the right is the reflective piece on this unit followed by the artefact:</p>

                <h2 class="major">Reflection on Unit 12</h2>
                <p>Participating in the debate on future SRM trends offered a valuable opportunity to consolidate my learning from the entire module. The preparation involved an in-depth review of the reading materials and wiki entries from Unit 11, which broadened my understanding of emerging trends in SRM.</p>
                <p>The knowledge gained from this unit was crucial in shaping my final e-Portfolio submission, where I integrated my learnings and reflections. Engaging in the debate allowed me to develop the ability to anticipate and adapt to evolving trends in the SRM landscape effectively.</p>
                <p>This reflective piece covers my individual contributions to the projects during the module, the comparative evaluation of the final project (Unit 11) and the status document (Unit 6), and my overall development in SRM.</p>
        
                <h3>Individual Contributions to Team Activities</h3>
                <p>During Unit 6, I played a pivotal role in our team's success by leading discussions and ensuring our meetings were productive and goal-oriented. My comprehensive research on ISO 31000 and FAIR models was essential for our risk assessment framework, and my efforts in compiling and editing the final report ensured a cohesive and clear presentation.</p>
        
                <h3>Evaluation of the Final Project vs. Status Document</h3>
                <p>The transition from the collaborative project in Unit 6 to the individual project in Unit 11 was both challenging and rewarding. The collaborative project laid the groundwork for the final project, where I employed Monte Carlo simulations to conduct a detailed risk assessment. This individual task enabled me to delve deeper into quantitative assessments and develop a thorough DR plan, enhancing my analytical skills.</p>
        
                <h3>Reflections on Security and Risk Management Process</h3>
                <p>The Security and Risk Management process learned throughout this module has profoundly impacted my professional and personal growth. The collaborative efforts in Unit 6 and the independent work in Unit 11 helped me develop critical thinking, analytical skills, and the ability to work effectively both in teams and individually.</p>
                <p>The final project in Unit 11, which focused on quantitative assessments and DR plans, built on the collaborative experience from Unit 6. It provided a comprehensive understanding of recovery objectives and practical solutions, ensuring business continuity and enhancing my overall proficiency in SRM.</p>

                <p>Welcome to Week 12 where we will debate the question “what will be the most influential trend in SRM in the next 5 years?”. This will be based on the reading material (and lecturecast) from Unit 11, plus your entries in the Wiki (also created in Unit 11).</p>
                <h3>Key Concepts Covered</h3>

                <p>This unit provided a comprehensive debate on what will be the most influential trend in SRM in the next 5 years. Drawing on the reading material from Unit 11 and the collaborative efforts in the wiki, I was able to engage deeply with emerging trends and assess their potential impacts.</p>
                <p>The debate format encouraged critical thinking and allowed for a diverse range of perspectives to be considered. This exercise not only consolidated my understanding of the material but also honed my ability to articulate and defend my views on future trends in SRM.</p>
                <p>The end of module assignment, which involved the e-Portfolio submission, served as a capstone project that encapsulated all the learning and reflections from the entire course. The skills and insights gained throughout the modules significantly contributed to the successful completion of this assignment.</p>

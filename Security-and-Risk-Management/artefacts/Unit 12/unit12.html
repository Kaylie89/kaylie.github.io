                <p>This unit brought together our knowledge and experiences to debate the most influential trends in Security and Risk Management (SRM) for the next five years. We engaged in dynamic discussions, evaluating emerging trends and their potential impact on the field.</p>
                <h3>Key Concepts Covered</h3>
                <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
                    <li><strong>Debate Preparation:</strong> Formulating arguments to support or oppose various trends in SRM.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wiki Completion:</strong> Enhancing our understanding through collaborative entries on future trends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trend Evaluation:</strong> Critically assessing the influence of different trends on the future of SRM.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This unit provided a platform to consolidate our knowledge and engage in a dynamic discussion about the future of SRM. To the right is the reflective piece on this unit followed by the artefact:</p>

                <h2 class="major">Reflection on Unit 12</h2>
                <p>Engaging in the debate on future SRM trends was an enlightening experience. It required thorough preparation, including a deep dive into the reading materials from Unit 11. This process significantly enhanced my understanding of various emerging trends in SRM.</p>
                <p>The insights gained from this unit were instrumental in shaping my final e-Portfolio submission, where I synthesised my learning and reflections from the entire module. Evaluating and debating future trends has equipped me to anticipate and adapt to changes in the SRM landscape effectively.</p>
                <p>This reflective piece addresses my individual contributions to the projects carried out during the module, the evaluation of the final project (Unit 11) vs. the status document (Unit 6), and reflections on my development in SRM.</p>
                <h3>Individual Contributions to Team Activities</h3>
                <p>In Unit 6, my contributions were integral to the team's success. I led several discussions, ensuring productive and goal-oriented meetings. I conducted thorough research on ISO 31000 and FAIR models, which were critical for our risk assessment framework. My efforts in compiling and editing the final report ensured coherence and clarity.</p>
                <h3>Evaluation of the Final Project vs. Status Document</h3>
                <p>The transition from the collaborative project in Unit 6 to the individual project in Unit 11 was challenging yet rewarding. The collaborative project laid the groundwork for the final project, where I applied Monte Carlo simulations for a detailed risk assessment. This individual task allowed me to dive deeper into quantitative assessments and develop a comprehensive DR plan.</p>
                <h3>Reflections on Security and Risk Management Process</h3>
                <p>The Security and Risk Management process I learned throughout this module has significantly impacted my professional and personal development. The team activities in Unit 6 and the individual project in Unit 11 helped me develop critical thinking, analytical skills, and the ability to work both collaboratively and independently.</p>
                <p>The final project in Unit 11, focusing on quantitative assessments and DR plans, built on the collaborative experience from Unit 6. It provided a comprehensive understanding of recovery objectives and practical solutions to ensure business continuity.</p>

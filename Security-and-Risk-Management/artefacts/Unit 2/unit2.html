                <p>This unit focused on understanding the Risk Management Process (RMP) and the effects of different assessment types (Qualitative vs. Quantitative). It also emphasized the importance of user participation in the risk management process.</p>
                <h3>Key Concepts Covered</h3>
                <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;"> 
                    <li><strong>Risk Management Process (RMP):</strong> An in-depth look at the steps involved in managing risks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assessment Types:</strong> Comparing qualitative and quantitative assessments.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Participation:</strong> The role and impact of users in RMP.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The seminar on user participation in RMP provided valuable insights into how user involvement can influence risk management outcomes. To the right is the reflective piece on this unit:</p>

                <h2 class="major">Reflection on Unit 2</h2>
                <p>This unit deepened my understanding of the Risk Management Process by comparing qualitative and quantitative assessments. The seminar highlighted the crucial role of user participation in effective risk management. I learned that involving users can lead to more comprehensive risk assessments and better implementation of mitigation strategies. This knowledge is vital for my development as a security professional.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Collaborative Discussion Reflection</h2>
                <p>In Unit 2, I studied the case study by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019), which discusses the application of Industry 4.0 in traditional business processes and the associated risks. While I did not actively participate in the discussion forum, I gained valuable insights from the reading.</p>
                <p><strong>Understanding Industry 4.0:</strong><br>
                Industry 4.0 refers to the integration of advanced digital technologies into traditional business processes, creating smart factories and interconnected systems. Examples include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smart Manufacturing: Utilizing IoT (Internet of Things) to monitor and optimize production processes in real-time.</li>
                        <li>Predictive Maintenance: Using sensors and data analytics to predict equipment failures before they occur, reducing downtime.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Real-World Examples of Risks:</strong><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cybersecurity Threats: Increased connectivity can lead to vulnerabilities in cyber-attacks.</li>
                        <li>Data Privacy Concerns: Handling large volumes of data can lead to breaches of sensitive information.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Supporting/Contradicting Article:</strong><br>
                A study by Smith et al. (2020) supports the risk categories identified by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, emphasizing the importance of robust cybersecurity measures in Industry 4.0 environments.</p>

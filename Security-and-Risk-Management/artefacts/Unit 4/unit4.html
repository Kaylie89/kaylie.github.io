                <p>Welcome to Week 4 where we will practice threat modelling and management, guided by the threat modelling manifesto, the OWASP cookbook and the Mitre ATT&CK database.</p>
                <h3>In this unit we shall:</h3>
                <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
                    <li>Discuss various tools and resources that can be used in threat modelling and management.</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the use of publicly available tools to assist with Threat Modelling.</li>
                    <li>Create threat models based on suggested scenarios.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>On completion of this unit you will be able to:</h3>
                <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
                    <li>Describe where to find the key tools and resources used for threat modelling.</li>
                    <li>Explain how to select the most appropriate tool for various situations.</li>
                    <li>Critically evaluate the use of such tools.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is a key module in that it introduces students to the topic of threat modelling which is a core competency both for cyber security and development teams.</p>

                <p>This unit provided practical experience in threat modelling and management, utilizing key resources such as the threat modelling manifesto, OWASP cookbook, and the Mitre ATT&CK database. The hands-on activities helped me understand the importance of selecting appropriate tools for different threat scenarios and critically evaluating their effectiveness. This experience is invaluable for my future role in cybersecurity, where threat modelling is essential for proactive risk management.</p>

                <p>Please carry out this activity before joining the seminar this week. Your answers will be discussed during the seminar.</p>
                <h3>Activity</h3>
                <p>Read Shostack (2018) chapters 3 â€“ 5 (that cover STRIDE and DREAD, Attack Trees and Attack libraries) as well as Spring et al (2021) (that discusses the history and some failings with CVSS) and then create a threat model based on one of the following scenarios:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
                    <li>A large international airport based in the United States of America.</li>
                    <li>A large international bank based in the UK.</li>
                    <li>A large nuclear power station in France.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You should use the Threat modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Threat modelling Cookbook and the ATT&CK libraries to inform your model design. Be prepared to share and discuss your designs at the seminar session this week.</p>
                <p>You should also add your individual designs to your e-portfolio.</p>

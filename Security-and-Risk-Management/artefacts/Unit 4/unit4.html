                <p>In this unit, we explored practical applications of threat modelling and management techniques. We were guided by essential resources such as the Threat Modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Threat Modelling Cookbook, and the Mitre ATT&CK database.</p>
                <h3>Key Concepts Covered</h3>

                    <li><strong>Threat Modelling Tools and Resources:</strong> Discussion on various tools and resources for threat modelling and management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Publicly Available Tools:</strong> Evaluation of the use of publicly available tools to assist with threat modelling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Threat Model Creation:</strong> Creation of threat models based on suggested scenarios.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This unit emphasized the importance of selecting appropriate tools for different threat scenarios and critically evaluating their effectiveness. Below is the reflective piece on this unit:</p>

                <p>This unit provided practical experience in threat modelling and management, utilizing key resources such as the Threat Modelling Manifesto, OWASP Cookbook, and the Mitre ATT&CK database. The hands-on activities helped me understand the importance of selecting appropriate tools for different threat scenarios and critically evaluating their effectiveness. This experience is invaluable for my future role in cybersecurity, where threat modelling is essential for proactive risk management.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Artefact: Threat Modelling Project</h2>
                <p>In this artefact, I created a detailed threat model for a large international airport based in the United States. This project involved using the Threat Modelling Manifesto, OWASP Threat Dragon, and the Mitre ATT&CK database to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities. The artefact includes diagrams and detailed analysis demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Unit 4 Seminar: Threat Modelling Exercises</h2>
                <p>Before joining the seminar, please complete the following activity. Your answers will be discussed during the seminar.</p>
                <h3>Activity</h3>
                <p>Read Shostack (2018) chapters 3 â€“ 5 (covering STRIDE and DREAD, Attack Trees, and Attack libraries) and Spring et al (2021) (discussing the history and some failings with CVSS). Then, create a threat model based on one of the following scenarios:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
                    <li>A large international airport based in the United States of America.</li>
                    <li>A large international bank based in the UK.</li>
                    <li>A large nuclear power station in France.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Use the Threat Modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Threat Modelling Cookbook, and the ATT&CK libraries to inform your model design. Be prepared to share and discuss your designs at the seminar session this week.</p>
                <p>Add your individual designs to your e-portfolio.</p>

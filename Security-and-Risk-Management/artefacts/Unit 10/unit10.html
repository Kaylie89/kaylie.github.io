                <p>This unit focuses on the practical aspects of disaster recovery (DR) and explores some typical designs for a DR solution.</p>
                <h3>Key Concepts Covered</h3>
                <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
                    <li><strong>Impact of RPO and RTO:</strong> Discussing the impact of Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) values on DR solutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Typical System Solutions:</strong> Examining some typical system solutions to meet the various standby requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Describing the limitations of the proposed solutions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The seminar provided practical insights into DR design and provision and offered a critical review of many accepted assumptions in such designs. To the right is the reflective piece on this unit:</p>

                <p>In this unit, I gained a deeper understanding of the practical aspects of disaster recovery (DR) implementations. The knowledge acquired from the lecturecasts and the seminar discussions was instrumental in enhancing my ability to design effective DR solutions.</p>
                <p>I learned about the significance of RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) values and their impact on DR solutions. This understanding enabled me to design solutions that meet specific RPO and RTO requirements effectively.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the unit covered the advantages and disadvantages of Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS), providing a comprehensive view of the challenges associated with vendor lock-in, resilience, and network security. This critical evaluation was essential for understanding the practical implications and limitations of various DR solutions.</p>
                <p>The insights gained from this unit were crucial in my final project (Unit 11), where I had to implement and evaluate a DR solution. The practical applications and theoretical knowledge from Unit 10 ensured that I could approach this task with a well-rounded understanding of DR strategies.</p>

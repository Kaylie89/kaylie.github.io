                <p>This unit focuses on two of the most important tools in the armoury of risk management and mitigation: business continuity and disaster recovery plans.</p>
                <h3>Key Concepts Covered</h3>
                <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
                    <li><strong>Creating BC/DR Plans:</strong> Reviewing how and why to create business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) plans.</li>
                    <li><strong>Determining Factors:</strong> Discussing the main determining factors in BC/DR plans â€“ including Business Impact Assessments (BIA), Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Emerging Trends:</strong> Discussing emerging trends in Information Risk Management.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The seminar provided practical insights into the importance of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and provided strategies to address various DR requirements. Below is the reflective piece on this unit:</p>

                <h2 class="major">Reflection on Unit 9</h2>
                <p>In this unit, I gained a comprehensive understanding of business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) plans. The lecturecast was particularly influential in enhancing my knowledge in this area. The insights provided through the lecturecast helped me understand the significance of BC/DR plans and how to effectively create and implement them.</p>
                <p>This knowledge was crucial in my final project (Unit 11), where I implemented a disaster recovery plan. The understanding of Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) gained from this unit was instrumental in determining the most suitable solutions to meet specific recovery objectives in the project.</p>
                <p>The strategies discussed in this unit, coupled with the practical application in my final project, have equipped me with the skills necessary to handle business continuity and disaster recovery in real-world scenarios.</p>
